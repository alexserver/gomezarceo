# Hi there!


I’m a Senior Web Engineer with a primary focus on Front End Applications. I have over 18 years of experience working with Web Technologies, with a strong emphasis on constructing User Interfaces.  
I enjoy building amazing Web Products transforming UI/UX designs into highly maintainable, efficient, well-tested, and readable code solutions.

My dedication to the products I work on is comprehensive, from end to end. I recognize the significance of meeting deadlines while consistently delivering high-quality software. 

I’m an advocate of the Kaizen principle, which promotes the idea that constant, incremental improvement is the key to achieving lasting and impactful success.

My mantra is _“Progress, not perfection”._

### Node.js Web Developer  
#### Jan 2014 - Aug 2015  

We developed a Rich Data Application from the ground up for our primary client in the Canadian oil industry. Our objective was to deliver Real-Time Data Applications utilizing Web Sockets and an SPA. We created a comprehensive library of complex UI components using Ractive as a Reactive DOM javascript library. 

Our main challenge was to deliver a huge amount of data to be updated in real time by the user, rendering a nested structure of complex Web Components in the shape of Web Forms and Rich Data Tables, such as how Google Sheets works. We had to iterate through some versions of the app to achieve the performance and speed the client needed for their daily data transactions.
