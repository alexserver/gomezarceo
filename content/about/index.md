# Who I am

I'm a Web Engineer, capable of working Full Stack, but rather enjoying working at the Front End side, and the Javascript
ecosystem, specifically with React Apps.

I'm also always open to learn a new tool, framework, or library to adapt to necessities. I'm language and framework agnostic, even though I have my favorites, I'm open to work with the best fit that a specific project demands at the time.

I'm comfortable with uncertainty, and have no problem with looking for answers and asking for help when the situation demands it.

I'm also a person that is always open to adapt and evolve, in regard to tech and soft skills. I'm an ongoing student, self learning oriented.
